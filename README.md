Definitions:
Our goal is to build a small web-based group chat app for at least 2 participants.
Each participant can post a message that will be displayed in the group chat feed.

Requirements:

To simplify, a view should include 2 chat-components (views); one for each participant
Each chat-component should include a feed and an input field for posting messages
Each chat-component has a unique name for posting messages (“User 1”, “User 2”...)
Show in the chat feed the name of participant, message and time of every post

Nice to have:

Functionality to quickly add more chat-component and post the message that 'user #X' is joined
Slick look
